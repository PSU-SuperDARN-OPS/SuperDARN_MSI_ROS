The following are notes taken while trying to install/setup the ROS.3.6 code on
an Ubuntu 12.04 linux computer.  
by Kevin Sterne


Pulled Adak operations branch

Edit .bashrc for site specific things.

Install zlib with:
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev

cd into ros.3.6/build/script/

do a 'make.build'

then do a 'make.code superdarn ros.3.6'

Got an error in dmaptocdf.1.8, couldn't find cdf.h but manually found a bunch of rcdf.h files.  

So, instead, download cdf package from: ftp://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ and follow install/build instructions.  Here on Ubuntu 12, you may have to install the ncurses.h package by doing:

sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

Continue with cdf package install/build instructions making sure to set the INSTALLDIR to /usr/local/cdf when doing the make install commmand.

Back to trying to compile the ros code, now get an error on netcdf.h not found from the dmaptoncdf code.

Downloaded netcdf library from: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/netcdf-install.html and try to install.

Here, I also had to install hdf5 and zlib first... These can be found at: ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/netcdf-4/

...screw dmaptoncdf function, taring that up for later.

had to comment out argtable.h	

make.code superdarn ros.3.6 now compiles perfectly!

Upon trying to run the radar, having problems with finding the site libraries, for example libsite.fhe.1.so is not found...because they don't exist in this branch!  Doh!

Copied over the ade and adw site libraries and made a few changes here.  Mostly renaming from adw -> fhw and that such, but also changed day/night times in site.c file.

Recompiled and then started the radar, but got an error of an undefined symbol: clock_gettime.  Added -lrt to makefiles for site libraries and then recompiled.  Still doesn't work...what?

Added:

LFLAGS += -lrt

to the makefiles for the fhe/fhw site libraries and away it goes!
